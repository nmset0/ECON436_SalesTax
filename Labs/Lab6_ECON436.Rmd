# Ex 1
Figure 1 shows the ACFs for 36 random numbers, 360 random numbers and 1,000 random numbers.


a. Explain the differences among these figures. Do they all indicate that the data are white noise?


As sample size increases, the variation decreases, and the autocorrelation value decreases. All these figures appear to be white noise.


b. Why are the critical values at different distances from the mean of zero? Why are the autocorrelations different in each figure when they each refer to white noise?


The values differ in distance because of the smaller variance and larger sample size. The expected value of white noise is zero, so the critical values will continue to approach zero as sample increases.


# Ex 2
a. Produce a time plot of the sheep population of England and Wales from 1867--1939 (data set `sheep`). Use the function ndiffs() to see how many times the time series needs to be differentiated to be stationary.

```{r 2a}
data(sheep)
ts.plot(sheep, main = "Sheep Time Series") # time-series plot
ndiffs(sheep) # how many times the time series needs to be differentiated to become stationary
```

The time series needs to be differentiated one time to be stationary.

b. Assume you decide to fit the following model:$y_t=y_{t−1}+\phi_1(y_{t−1}−y_{t−2})+\phi_2(y_{t−2}−y_{t−3})+\phi_3(y_{t−3}−y_{t−4})+\epsilon_t$,where $\epsilon_t$ is a white noise series. What sort of ARIMA model is this (i.e., what are p, d, and q)?


This is an ARIMA(3, 1, 0) model.


c. By examining the ACF and PACF of the differenced data, explain why this model is appropriate.

```{r 2c}
sheep <- diff(sheep) # differencing the series 1 time
acf(sheep, main = "Sheep ACF") # autocorrelation plot
pacf(sheep, main = "Sheep PACF") # partial autocorrelation plot
```

The ACF yields an order of 3, and the data needs to be differenced one time.


```{r sheepfit, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
fit <- auto.arima(sheep, seasonal = FALSE, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE)
# fit <- Arima(sheep, order = c(3, 1, 0))
fit$coef
```


d. The last five values of the series are given below:

|Year              | 1935| 1936| 1937| 1938| 1939|
|:-----------------|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
|Millions of sheep | 1648| 1665| 1627| 1791| 1797|

The estimated parameters are $\phi_1$=0.421, $\phi_2$=−0.202, and $\phi_3$=−0.304. Without using the forecast function, calculate forecasts for the next three years (1940–1942). 

```{r 2d}
# function to predict sheep
predictSheep <- function(c, y1, y2, y3, y4) {
  # calculate predictions with the provided coefficients
  c_pred <- c + (y1 - y2) * 0.421 + (y2 - y3) * (-.202) + (y3 - y4) * (-.304) # y1 = y_{t-1}, y2 = y_{t-2}, etc.
  return(c_pred)
}

# store predictions
c1 <- predictSheep(1797, 1791, 1627, 1665, 1648)
c2 <- predictSheep(c1, 1797, 1791, 1627, 1665)
c3 <- predictSheep(c2, 1717, 1797, 1791, 1627)

# print results
cat("Predicted Number of Sheep in 1940:", round(c1), "\n")
cat("Predicted Number of Sheep in 1941:", round(c2), "\n")
cat("Predicted Number of Sheep in 1942:", round(c3), "\n")
```


e. Now fit the model in R and obtain the forecasts using the function forecast(). Are they different from yours?

```{r 2e}
forecast(fit, h = 3)
```


Yes, they are different from my estimations, but they are within the 95 percent interval.


# Ex 3

a. Plot the annual bituminous coal production in the United States from 1920 to 1968 (data set bicoal).Use the function ndiffs() to see how many times the time series needs to be differentiated to be stationary.

```{r}
autoplot(bicoal) +
  ggtitle("Annual Bituminous Coal Production in the U.S. (1920-1968)") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Production")

dneeded <- ndiffs(bicoal)
print(dneeded)
```

b. You decide to fit the following model to the series:yt=c+ϕ1yt−1+ϕ2yt−2+ϕ3yt−3+ϕ4yt−4+εtwhere yt is the coal production in year t and εt is a white noise series. What sort of ARIMA model is this (i.e., what are p, d, and q)?

This is an ARIMA(4, 0, 0)/ar(4) model because it uses autoregressive terms up to 4 lags  
p=4
d=0
q=0

c. Explain why this model was chosen using the ACF and PACF.

The PACF shows 4 significant lags before cutting off, while the ACF decayed gradually, indicating an autoregressive process rather than a moving average or mixed model.

```{r}

```

d.) Fit the model to the data using the Arima function. Note that you will need to set the
parameter include.constant=TRUE. Check that c=162.00, φ1=0.83, φ2=−0.34, φ3=0.55,
andφ4=−0.38. Note that the Arima function doesn’t provide you with c directly. It
provides you with the mean of the time series. You can calculate c by running:
c <- mu * (1-phi1-phi2-phi3-phi4)


```{r bicoalfit, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

fit <- Arima(bicoal, order = c(4, 0, 0), include.constant = TRUE)
summary(fit)


phi1 <- fit$coef["ar1"]
phi2 <- fit$coef["ar2"]
phi3 <- fit$coef["ar3"]
phi4 <- fit$coef["ar4"]
mu <- fit$coef["intercept"]  #mu


c <- mu * (1 - phi1 - phi2 - phi3 - phi4)

print(c, 2)
print(phi1, 2)
print(phi2, 2)
print(phi3, 2)
print(phi4, 2)


```
e. The last five values of the series are given below.

|Year              | 1964| 1965| 1966| 1967| 1968|
|:-----------------|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
|Millions of tons  | 467 | 512 | 534 | 552 | 545 |

Without using the `forecast` function, calculate forecasts for the next three years (1969--1971) using R.
```{r}
y <- as.numeric(bicoal)

# Manual forecast function
forecast_ar4 <- function(y, c, phi1, phi2, phi3, phi4, h) {
  forecasts <- numeric(h)
  for (t in 1:h) {
    forecasts[t] <- c + 
                    phi1 * y[length(y)] +    
                    phi2 * y[length(y)-1] +  
                    phi3 * y[length(y)-2] +  
                    phi4 * y[length(y)-3]     
    y <- c(y, forecasts[t])  # Append forecast to extend the series
  }
  return(forecasts)
}

# Generate forecasts
forecasts <- forecast_ar4(y, c, phi1, phi2, phi3, phi4, h = 3)
names(forecasts) <- 1969:1971
print(round(forecasts, 4))



```



f. Now fit the model in R and obtain the forecasts from the same model. How are they different from yours? Why?

```{r}
auto_forecasts <- forecast(fit, h = 3)
print(auto_forecasts)
```
they are the same as our forecasts as they use the same coefficents to forecast the data.
