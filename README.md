# ECON436 Sales Tax Project

"Decision makers in both the public and private sectors rely on data to make decisions. Government agencies and public leaders utilize data to inform public policy. As the world enters this new paradigm, employment in the field of economics will increasingly require an ability to access, clean, and manipulate the data for effective analysis and presentation. The class will explore ways of cleaning, understanding, analyzing, and presenting such data using the R statistical programming language. In particular, students will develop a range of forecasting skills to become effective forecasters in both the private and public sectors. They will focus on the acquisition of time series data coming from government and semi-private websites, and on the most popular econometric techniques used in forecasting, including univariate and vector error correction (VECM) models. Our class will culminate in a group presentation to city officials from the city of Fort Collins."

Instructor: Dr. Sophie McKee

The purpose of this project is, through the utilization of R software and data collection, to predict the amount of sales tax revenue the city of Fort Collins will collect in the year 2025. Students were granted the opportunity to participate in a group presentation to city officials from the city of Fort Collins and CSU professors. To view the culmination of their work, see Forecasting2025.pdf and SalesTaxPresentation_22April.pdf.
